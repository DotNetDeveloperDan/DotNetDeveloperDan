Hi, I'm Daniel Pollack 👋

Senior Full‑Stack .NET Engineer • Micro‑services Aficionado • Cloud‑Native Advocate

17+ years turning legacy monoliths into high‑performance, cloud‑ready platforms.

🚀 About Me

Current: Senior Full‑Stack Engineer @ STAG Securities — building sub‑second commodity‑pricing pipelines (TT SDK → Kafka → Redis → React/SignalR) and a Hangfire‑powered scheduling platform.

Past highlights:

Modernized Progressive Leasing’s credit‑bureau monolith into 12 .NET 8 micro‑services running in AWS.

Architected HIPAA‑compliant APIs & MAUI mobile apps at TurningPoint Healthcare.

Led SaaS API and mobile rewrite for 200+ AAA/CAA clubs at Club Assist.

Focus areas: Distributed systems, real‑time data feeds, DevOps automation, secure auth (Auth0/Okta/CyberArk), and mentoring dev teams on clean architecture.

Fun fact: I keep a Black Moor fancy goldfish and a cat named Luna 🐟🐈
